- Revisit "integrity" on features.
- Probably split Master and Owner
- Maybe move Commands to Player Component?  Or not, it's really big.

master.master and owner.owner are clumsy...maybe ruledBy and ownedBy?

- refactor world generation...what a mess...get rid of magic numbers

- Most of the restructuring of files is done, but some candidates remain:
	- tiles.js
	- generate.js
	- display.js

- use the new "done" method on task more often

- should probably make "wound" a method
