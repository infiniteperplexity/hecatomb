- Perlin worms for ore?

My ideas for today were...
- Improve decay



- push a new copy online
- Fine-tune zombie emergence just a little bit more.

- some notification for unowned items

fix up aquifers and ore?


- add dens


- Place more ores in mountains and wastes.


- wait do those coins exist in this font?

...So now I think I just start piling on interesting Encounters.
- Ant lions.
- Antman colonies.
- Peasants and adventurers (hamlet? homestead?)
- Small ruins (of buildings?)
- Huntsman's snare / huntsman.
- Grave robber.
- Ghul den.
- Proper graveyards.
- Fountains (1 wish? or other random effect like in NetHack?)
- Giant serpent's corpse.
- Fireflies.
