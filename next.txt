My ideas for today were...
- Improve decay

- Make snow smoother

- figure out why flooding sometimes fails...is it caves?

- push a new copy online
- Fine-tune zombie emergence just a little bit more.
- Add decay to corpses and zombies.

Add in the ROT.RNG stuff.

- some notification for unowned items

fix up aquifers and ore?


- add dens
- terrain boundaries maybe?


Change how graveyards and player starting locations work.

- Place more ores in mountains and wastes.

- graveyards

- wait do those coins exist in this font?
