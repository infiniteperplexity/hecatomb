My ideas for today were...
- Add decay.
- Work on terrain some more.

- fix range so worldgen never crashes

-- would be better, in the wastes, if we could also modify the octaves to use smaller ones.

- Take explode off tombstones and add it to ZombieEmerge.
- Add decay to corpses and zombies.

Add in the ROT.RNG stuff.



fix up aquifers and ore?


- add dens
- terrain boundaries maybe?

so...it's common with terrain generation, I think, to do cross-references of things like elevation, temperature, and moisture.

so...in this game, we'd like to have...

- swamps (moist, low)
- wastes (dry, low)
- forests (moist, medium)
- hills (dry, medium)
- mountains (high)

- lakes




- graveyards


...could be...
- mountains on left, lake on right.
- swamps bottom, forests middle, scrubland middle, wastes top?
Or do a "four corners" kind of approach?  We could do a gradient laid out on top of that.

So...what's in these terrains?
- rocks would be mostly in the mountains and wastes
- trees mostly in the forests
- sand in the wastes?
- herbs in their own places?
- graveyards in scrublands & forests...definitely not swamps.
- ores in mountains
special dangers in each corner (swamp, mountain, waste, lake)

Do the peasants/humans come from any particular direction?  Across the sea?

Ruins instead of wastelands?  or maybe make that the "good" area, with fewer graveyards, et cetera.

- Need to make it so elevations get rounded after biome placement.
