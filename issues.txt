- research still shows ingredients when noingredients is enabled
- rock types are hard to notice and don't unassign automatically
- furnishing should try to add production tasks
- minions digging out rooms have a tendency to block the hallway
- is the number of "spider failed to acts" unreasonably high?
- ore doesn't get stored anywhere
- I bet this Guard Post rallying thing is less flexible than you'd want...also, minions probably run outside the radius when facgint threats.
- Think about whether to show letter choices when ingredients aren't available.
