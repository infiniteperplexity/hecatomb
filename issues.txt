- furnishing should try to add production tasks...unless we simplify this even further by making it so those things get built like ramps do and just have prereqs.  But in that case, how much production actually happens?
- is the number of "spider failed to acts" unreasonably high?
- ore doesn't get stored anywhere
- you can kind of "cheat" and reveal unexplored terrain by seeing how DigTask assigns.  You could fight this by tagging the DigTask with the kind of terrain it's supposed to be on.
- I bet this Guard Post rallying thing is less flexible than you'd want...also, minions probably run outside the radius when facing threats.
- The way spells you can't cast are displayed is not consistent with ingredient deficits.
- Soil types break aquifers, currently.  Aquifers should be their own cover, I think.
- I don't think ore currently has hardness.
- Can I parameterize some of the randomized scattering?
- It's a pain to have to adjust nParcels every time...
- Should I be able to parameterize "SmallGraveyard", perhaps to make it not so small?  Right now it's a 3x3, 4 potential graves thing.
- The graveyard parcel is just like the player parcel but without the player, thus duplicating some code.
- The traps need to be invisible to other teams.
- The hunter probably needs missile weapons.
- The hunter should sleep at night.

- what's next? ghoul dens?  crows?

- flocking
	- avoid crowding
	- go towards heading
	- go towards position

- red and black ants
- findPlace should handle Z differently
- ants get placed on the ground level with findplace
- ant colony entrance is usually in top left corner
- ant colony can overlap with graveyards and stuff
- ant queens are potentially a "master"...does that break any assumptions?
- is the spawn probability for seaweed too high?

- fireflies only come out at night?  and they should tend to fly low.

- maybe "Yield" values of <1 are a drop rate?  Yeah, I like that!

- starting locations and graveyards seem to break the rules sometimes
- Sometimes ant colonies end up underwater.
- map should maybe show cave levels.


So...I've been blocked on this monster variant issue for quite a while.  And I'm realizing that maybe that's in part because I'm mistaking several different problems for one unified thing.


Corpses stack wrong...2 peasant corpses on top of a human zombie corpse become "3 human zombie corpses".

auto-claiming nearby rocks on start-up doesn't really accomplish what it should

the guard post rally doesn't play out even remotely the way I wanted it to

very rarely, you start underwater.

no warning for trying to dig holes through hard rock
soil color is kind of ugly.
infinite range on zombie raising is weird
if you don't find coal you're kind of screwed.
- tombstone deconstructed over zombie stops zombie from digging out.
- you can assign dismantle on walls for some reason and it causes all kinds of chaos
