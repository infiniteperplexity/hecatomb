refactoring brings up a ton of new issues...
- it's unclear that Types should still work exactly the way they do
- some things, like Crops, aren't working correctly
- we should probably refactor item lists as well
- we haven't checked whether saving the game works
- some things like craftable should probably be made into behaviors
- probably need a "claim item" task or some such thing to block multiple claims on the same item...subsidiary tasks
