- research still shows ingredients when noingredients is enabled
- furnishing should try to add production tasks...unless we simplify this even further by making it so those things get built like ramps do and just have prereqs.  But in that case, how much production actually happens?
- is the number of "spider failed to acts" unreasonably high?
- ore doesn't get stored anywhere
- you can kind of "cheat" and reveal unexplored terrain by seeing how DigTask assigns.  You could fight this by tagging the DigTask with the kind of terrain it's supposed to be on.
- I bet this Guard Post rallying thing is less flexible than you'd want...also, minions probably run outside the radius when facing threats.
- The way spells you can't cast are displayed is not consistent with ingredient deficits.
- Soil types break aquifers, currently.  Aquifers should be their own cover, I think.
- I don't think ore currently has hardness.
- I'm guessing that saved games are going to be hideously broken after all this refactoring.

- I don't hate the shape of herb patches, but I don't love it either.  Perlin worms might be better.
- Can I parameterize some of the randomized scattering?
- It's a pain to have to adjust nParcels every time...
- Should I be able to parameterize "SmallGraveyard", perhaps to make it not so small?  Right now it's a 3x3, 4 potential graves thing.
- The graveyard parcel is just like the player parcel but without the player, thus duplicating some code.
- It would be nice to have a unifying thing that kept stuff within bounds.
