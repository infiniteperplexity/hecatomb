Nothing really standing in my way now.  No excuses for not developing.  But I might need a bit of a break.

So...next up...

1)
- Flesh out the command system.
- Make it 3D.
- Do FOV.
- Make tiles an Enum or FlyWeight.
- Explored, visible.

2)
- Add zombie
- A* pathfinding.
- Entity/Component system.

3) 
- Dig task.
- Build task.

4) Migrate UI framework.
