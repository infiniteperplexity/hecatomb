So what would our approach be to refactoring the game?  Let's make this a wishlist.
- I think you basically just start by backing up Game.cs, start that again from scratch, and go from there.
- Let's take a look at this example code.  So, they've got a Global object.
- So what is it I'm actually looking to improve on here?
	- I want to take full advantage of the new null protections.
	- I want to totally shut down race conditions.
	- In my dreams, I log all game and interface events.
		- It's clear what a game event is.  An interface event is a little less clear.
	- I could try improve on some of the more intricate systems, like spawning, serializing, events, and so on.
	- I have some specific things I want to change, like getting rid of the JSON-loading text-key nonsnese.

So we have the "minimal MCV" thing down now.  So what's next?
- We want to generate the world
- We want to implement the normal controls
