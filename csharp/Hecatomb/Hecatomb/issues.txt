Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?
- Need confirmation for saved games
- The background color for severe wounds can clash with the foreground color.
- TextEntry keystroke responsiveness feels horrible.
- Maybe vampire bats should be cave shrikes or something.
- Weird things happen when you hover over the squares right near the edge of the screen.
- Additional spacebar selection clicks register too quickly
- Selecting unexplored tiles to dig handles taks priorities in weird ways
- NextMinion doesn't move the screen
- It's really hard to tell what ingredients are needed for partial structures.
- Should I cancel tasks when you can't find the ingredients, or unassign them?  I think unassign.
- Can I scrol up or down the message bar?
- Did saving the game destroy all my zombies?  Or did they rot away?
- Bandits showed up uninvited.
- Particle effects seemed to show wrong z level?
- exhumed corpses are not owned, nor are dropped trade goods
- zombies have no warning when they rot away
- dropped items should get unclaimed...is that an issue?
- can't overlay partial black market
- can't remove partial black market either; placed task gets canceled.

Gameplay issues:
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks.
- Should prefer paths around water and slopes.
- CanReach doesn't respect cached misses; perhaps we should refactor it.
* Bandits sometimes spawn underground (believed fixed)
* Bandits can attack me through the ceiling (believed fixed)
* Creatures that despawn without dying drop items (believed fixed)
- Dwarf lairs have no dwarves in them
- Dwarf lairs can overlap with bat caves
- Balance ghoul attacks
- You can't set up triggers to breach multiple caverns at once.
- Need to go through and make breaching work the way we really want it.
- Need to make it so liquids can flood.
- Hmmm...we could add the Creatures but not the Actors, for underground stuff.
- Should I add a simple raid?  This actually can't be done without refactoring how the Entity list works.
- should test decaying stuff
- Currently we can't handle it if a claimed item gets moved.

Other issues:
- Arguably should use iteration rather than recursion for NextActor.

Needs testing:
- Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?

New Features:
- We need good ways to keep zombies indoors during sieges.

Working on:
- Test repair task on doors

What should I do now
