Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?
- Need confirmation for saved games
- The background color for severe wounds can clash with the foreground color.
- TextEntry keystroke responsiveness feels horrible.
- Maybe vampire bats should be cave shrikes or something.
- Additional spacebar selection clicks register too quickly
* should be able to overlay partial construct using same building (fixed I think)
* Right now there's really weird treatment of abandoned build or dig tasks (probably fixed)
- We need Particle emitter constructors that can do colors and stuff

Gameplay issues:
* dropped items should get unclaimed...is that an issue?  I don't think it is, I think we unclaim upon pickup.
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks...maybe put in some debugging code to catch tasks that just sit there...should be testable using interface and locals
* Should prefer paths around water and slopes.
* CanReach doesn't respect cached misses; perhaps we should refactor it (I'm not sure this is true)
- Dwarf lairs have no dwarves in them
- Dwarf lairs can overlap with bat caves
- Balance ghoul attacks
- You can't set up triggers to breach multiple caverns at once.
- Should I add a simple raid?  This actually can't be done without refactoring how the Entity list works.
- should test decaying stuff
- Decay isn't fully thought out
- No guaranteed trees (or flint) near start
- There can be pathfinding delays when finding ingredients just to display the menu
- Pathfinding now avoids high movement costs, but wandering doesn't.
- Bandits sometimes slam performance
- Want to add in some LongCreatures somewhere.
- too hard to find flint in early game
- crashed with OutOfMemory error when saving
- The abandoned tasks appear to occur when the Minion loses its task but the task still has the Minion.

Other issues:
- Arguably should use iteration rather than recursion for NextActor.

Needs testing:
* Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?  Seems to.
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?  It's very slow, that's for sure.


New Features:
- We need good ways to keep zombies indoors during sieges.
