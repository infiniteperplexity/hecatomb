Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?
- Need confirmation for saved games
- The background color for severe wounds can clash with the foreground color.
- TextEntry keystroke responsiveness feels horrible.
- Maybe vampire bats should be cave shrikes or something.
* Weird things happen when you hover over the squares right near the edge of the screen.
- Additional spacebar selection clicks register too quickly
* Should I make it so ColoredText overrides +?

* NextMinion doesn't move the screen.  Fixed.
- It's really hard to tell what ingredients are needed for partial structures.
* Should I cancel tasks when you can't find the ingredients, or unassign them?  I think unassign.
* Can I scroll up or down the message bar?
* Did saving the game destroy all my zombies?  Or did they rot away?  I think they rotted away.
* Bandits showed up uninvited.  Ithink I just cast the spell accidentally...but then why no splash?
* Particle effects seemed to show wrong z level?
* exhumed corpses are not owned, nor are dropped trade goods (believed fixed)
* zombies have no warning when they rot away
- dropped items should get unclaimed...is that an issue?
* can't overlay partial black market (mostly fixed)
- should be able to overlay partial construct using same building
* Selecting unexplored tiles to dig handles taks priorities in weird ways (believed fixed)
* can't remove partial black market either; placed task gets canceled (believed fixed)
- Right now there's really weird treatment of abandoned build or dig tasks

Gameplay issues:
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks...maybe put in some debugging code to catch tasks that just sit there...
- Should prefer paths around water and slopes.
- CanReach doesn't respect cached misses; perhaps we should refactor it.
* Bandits sometimes spawn underground (believed fixed)
* Bandits can attack me through the ceiling (believed fixed)
* Creatures that despawn without dying drop items (believed fixed)
- Dwarf lairs have no dwarves in them
- Dwarf lairs can overlap with bat caves
- Balance ghoul attacks
- You can't set up triggers to breach multiple caverns at once.
* Need to go through and make breaching work the way we really want it.
* Need to make it so liquids can flood (simple flooding now exists)
* Hmmm...we could add the Creatures but not the Actors, for underground stuff.
- Should I add a simple raid?  This actually can't be done without refactoring how the Entity list works.
- should test decaying stuff
* Currently we can't handle it if a claimed item gets moved.  Believed fixed.
* The repair code doesn't actually exist.
- Can't order repairs via overlay
- Decay isn't fully thoughts out
- No guaranteed trees (or flint) near start
* Construct and research tasks names are horribly wrong
* Display research tasks don't highlight missing ingredients
* Tasks should probably list ingredients on hover
* Displacement can cause creature overlap (believed fixed)
- There can be pathfinding delays when finding ingredients just to display the menu

Other issues:
- Arguably should use iteration rather than recursion for NextActor.

Needs testing:
* Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?  Seems to.
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?  It's very slow, that's for sure.


New Features:
- We need good ways to keep zombies indoors during sieges.
