Bugs:
? Infinite item displacement loops - believed solved.
? Haul tasks target full piles - possibly solved.
? Items get displaced even when piles aren't full - seems solved.
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks and won't go back...need to reproduce and check if they're still assigned.

Misfeatures:
X We shouldn't claim multiple haulable items at once, should we? - solved
- Does stockpiling have lowest priority?
- The hostility check system is kind of a mess; it can only go by team.

Improvements:
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Character spacing looks wrong for menu and status panels.
- Is there a way to enable multiple fetchers for multi-ingredient tasks?
- Lots of tasks, structures, and other stuff have names show up badly.
- If you hover over a square and someone drops something on the square, it doesn't update the menu.  This can occasionally cause weird crashes.

Features:
- We need some way to dismantle and/or repair, but we don't want tasks to proliferate.
- Should show more info upon creature selection.
