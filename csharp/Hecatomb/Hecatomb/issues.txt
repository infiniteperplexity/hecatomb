Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?
- Need confirmation for saved games
- The background color for severe wounds can clash with the foreground color.
* TextEntry keystroke responsiveness feels horrible.
- Maybe vampire bats should be cave shrikes or something.
- Additional spacebar selection clicks register too quickly
* should be able to overlay partial construct using same building (fixed I think)
* Right now there's really weird treatment of abandoned build or dig tasks (probably fixed)
- We need Particle emitter constructors that can do colors and stuff
- Maybe research tasks should show turns when there are no ingredients
- Zombies somehow can get stuck highlighted, so can structures.
- Easy way to count zombies?
- Call things "rotten" when they are decaying?
- Can we cancel haultasks to allow construction?
* Got the "managed to avoid spending action points" error during a fight...maybe something got killed partway through?
- Z is both diagonal key and also spells
- Can't "build" to unassign digging in walls, only floors
- Should "wait" recenter on the player, or on the selected creature?

Gameplay issues:
* dropped items should get unclaimed...is that an issue?  I don't think it is, I think we unclaim upon pickup.
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks...maybe put in some debugging code to catch tasks that just sit there...should be testable using interface and locals
* Should prefer paths around water and slopes.
* CanReach doesn't respect cached misses; perhaps we should refactor it (I'm not sure this is true)
- Dwarf lairs have no dwarves in them
- Dwarf lairs can overlap with bat caves
- Balance ghoul attacks
- You can't set up triggers to breach multiple caverns at once.
- Should I add a simple raid?  This actually can't be done without refactoring how the Entity list works.
- should test decaying stuff
- Decay isn't fully thought out
- No guaranteed trees (or flint) near start
- There can be pathfinding delays when finding ingredients just to display the menu
- Pathfinding now avoids high movement costs, but wandering doesn't.
* Bandits sometimes slam performance...I think this was solved by filling vaults on-the-fly
- Want to add in some LongCreatures somewhere.
* too hard to find flint in early game - arguably fixed
- crashed with OutOfMemory error when saving (did we fix this?)
- The abandoned tasks appear to occur when the Minion loses its task but the task still has the Minion.
	- Are there times when we assign a task and it overwrites another?
	- Should I look for every occurrence of task = null or unassign?  or overwriting?
	- I could also just write something to clean up automatically.
- I'm getting "what the heck?" as the name for a haul task...maybe that's after it's been picked up?
* Unclear why Deck and Queue from TurnHandler appear as serialized fields (resolved, I handle them in a customized way)
- ForbidTask appears to do nothing and also have no name
- Ghoul radius is too small
- Notification for canceling dig task for hard walls?
- Should nighttime be a bit more dangerous?
- I can't seem to furnish a door on top of a damaged door.
- I saw a grave occur next to a slope...first time I've seen that in ages
- Oh, we finally have a listener priority issue...Minion (patrolling around the player) versus RallyTask (rallying around the task)
- Are bone and flesh harvested not claimed? No, the issue was related to the next issue.
- If something is claimed by a haul task, should I be able to unclaim it for other tasks?
* Spiders not moving...solved, that was leftover test code
- Should add spider silk and a use thereof
- Need a way to cycle trades
- There's a whole lot of flint now
- Do we describe decay on zombies?
- Do multiple layers of doors prevent sieges?
- Should almost certainly guarantee visible trees.
- Maybe I should manually handle the rotting zombie color gradient	
- N of zombies seems like something maybe we should show prominently.
- Still sometimes takes forever to find flint, and sometimes there's so much!
- Do a sweep of all task creation, to see if we missed an double-placement issues.
- should flesh rot when it's not stored?  we'll add this eventually.
- should implement corpse types

Performance Issues:
* Don't need to serialize hostility matrix
* The VaultHandler takes up about a sixth of the line count, and has many redundant messages.
- We serialize a lot of unnecessary stuff in general.
* Is it that bandits at long distance flog performance?
* Arguably should use iteration rather than recursion for NextActor.
- WalkToward should probably use cache.
- For some reason, setting a TileEntityField = null causes an error; I thought I fixed that.
* So...spiders awake still slams performance.
- Redraw goes very slowly when we're looking at a screen that has ingredients

Other issue

Needs testing:
* Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?  Seems to.
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?  It's very slow, that's for sure.
- Did something despawn when I saved the game?

New Features:
- We need good ways to keep zombies indoors during sieges.
- A rally point would work for this for now.

Needs sorted:
* deal with the ingredient menu slam.
* show turns on research tasks
* no more "stuck highlights"...maybe make that a singleton state
* deal with double-use of Z
* fix build to unassign dig in walls
* "wait" recenters on selection
* implement forbidtask
* notify on hard walls cancel dig
* add a way to cycle trades
* colorize the tasks
* better naming and colors for rotten stuff, check that corpses rot
* Make it so corpses show signs of rot I guess.
* revise code for guaranteeing starting area
* test furnishing door on top of damaged door to repair
* Is there any way to repair a damaged structural feature?
* I don't think the corpse names showed up correctly?
* zombies arguably rot too fast
* don't need to show ingredients for haul tasks or butcher tasks
* sanctum should allow +1 zombie
* clicking creature should prioritize over clicking structure
* maybe randomize starting decay?
* graphics for chirurgeon are a bit repetitive to sanctum
* number of turns left doesn't update correctly while waiting (believed fixed)
* trade task display name should tell me turns left.
* trade task in building description has badly formatted name
* rotten zombies shouldn't leave corpses
* keep an eye out for bad task names
* "zombie couldn't find needed keys"?   wtf?
* I got a "what the heck?" haul one rock message...so this is when a haul tasks has no claims, which means it's invalid.
* got a crash from hovering over a butcher tasks whose corpse had decayed out from under it
* keep an eye out for the desynced tasks...or did we solve that?  I think I saw one recently.
* let's get rid of this message "trying look at despawned components?"
* "butcher a corpse from" makes no sense when it's on the hovered task...actually it never makes sense
* butcher tasks should go faster
* add better trades...coal, etc.
* get rid of article name in black market, and it should have ingredients listed; it seems like we aren't fulfilling the ingredients in the normal way?
* diagonal grave digging should also not dig a hole...eh...
* Forge also looks like Sanctum
* should add deconstruction of workshop for flint?
* got a "Trade for 1 trade goods" task on the menu somehow...
* library also looks exactly like sanctum
* toggling claims...should unclaim ingredients?  made it so it cancels the task
* treasury should look a little different from stockpile
* stockpile should show contents
* Should stockpiles contribute to a central resource listing?
* I think there's a race condition when you kick off a new game (I think this is now fixed)
* Why are we skipping the "click any button" stage?
* got no message when zombie rotted away
* too many "assigned material too hard status bar messages
* Oh wow, Unassign was asymmetrical...that's probably been the culprit all along
* do we have speed adjustment?
* weird stuff going on newly generated trade tasks
* message when zombie expires
* I don't think task priority is working? no, it is.
* haul task carried by uses wrong name
* updating research turns on menu doesn't work still
