Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Text panels don't do spacing correctly.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?

Gameplay issues:
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks.


Needs testing:
- Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?
- Has the frustration mechanic been fully implemented?

New Features:
- Better ways to control zombie behavior.

Working on:
 - The humantracker OnTurnBegin has only a tenuous connection to actually starting bandit attacks.
 - We need some kind of forced delay for splash screens.
 * We now can use space to select things, but the way the cursor works with the mouse is counterintuitive.  Check the old game.
