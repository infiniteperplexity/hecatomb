Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?
- Need confirmation for saved games
- The background color for severe wounds can clash with the foreground color.
- TextEntry feels gross.

Gameplay issues:
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks.
- Should prefer paths around water and slopes.
- CanReach doesn't respect cached misses; perhaps we should refactor it.
* Bandits sometimes spawn underground (believed fixed)
* Bandits can attack me through the ceiling (believed fixed)
* Creatures that despawn without dying drop items (believed fixed)


Needs testing:
- Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?

New Features:
- Better ways to control zombie behavior.

Working on:
