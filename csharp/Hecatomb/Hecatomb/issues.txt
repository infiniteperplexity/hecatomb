Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Text panels don't do spacing correctly.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?

Gameplay issues:
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks.


Needs testing:
- Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?
- Has the frustration mechanic been fully implemented?

New Features:
- Better ways to control zombie behavior.

Working on:
- Should make it so WalkToward caches misses
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Make sure death and despawning are separate, don't drop items when just despawning
- Need to account for siege creatures that can't even reach the player through doors?
- look up passing through default arguments
- shuld path around water
- Make typing save game names less sensitive

Sieges:
- Current status...i need to rethink the order of checks for frustration and hostility


Alright, so let's take a look at the script..
- We could completely override act, by having a field that override stuff.
- We could have an event chain that overrides stuff.
- Is "Goals" ever actually a thing?  Not yet.
- I could give these things simpler names...Alert(); Serve(); Wander();
- I could also incorporate the !Acted stuff into the beginning of those things.

What about an event-based framework?  I think it would be OnAct...and you'd pass the Event as an argument, which would tell you whether
it had been...eh.  Okay, actually, you'd simply know based on "Acted" whether you still have to do anything.  So...the
main problem with the Event framework, is that you'd need to introduce a system for priorities.

So...you could have Minion components listen to OnAct, and the same for HumanTracker components.

If the only two standard actions are Alert() and Wander(), then there are really only two possible places to do those things,
could we viably make this two events, before and after alert?  That way, Minion can be a thing that kicks in after alert, whereas
HumanTracker kicks in before?  Eh...let's just get something working for now and move forward.
