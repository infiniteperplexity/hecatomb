Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Text panels don't do spacing correctly.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?

Gameplay issues:
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks.


Needs testing:
- Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?
- Has the frustration mechanic been fully implemented?

New Features:
- Better ways to control zombie behavior.

Working on:
- The splash panel flickers a bit.
X Spiders absolutely flog the performance, presumably due to hostility checks?
X Nope, it's not the spiders, it's something else.
- It's not related to the splash panel.
- The most likely culprit would seem to be long-distance pathfinding.
