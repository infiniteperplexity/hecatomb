Bugs:
? Infinite item displacement loops - believed solved.
? Haul tasks target full piles - possibly solved.
? Items get displaced even when piles aren't full - seems solved.
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks and won't go back...need to reproduce and check if they're still assigned.
? Can assign a contruction task over solid tiles
? Dropped items are unowned - believed fixed
- Building a ramp should clear the cover on teh square above, including mining it if necessary.
- Something weird goes on with fonts and box-drawing characters.

Misfeatures:
X We shouldn't claim multiple haulable items at once, should we? - solved
? Does stockpiling have lowest priority? I think it's now fixed.
- The hostility check system is kind of a mess; it can only go by team.

Improvements:
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Character spacing looks wrong for menu and status panels.
- Is there a way to enable multiple fetchers for multi-ingredient tasks?
- Lots of tasks, structures, and other stuff have names show up badly.
- If you hover over a square and someone drops something on the square, it doesn't update the menu.  This can occasionally cause weird crashes.
- Would be nice if creatures could intelligently displace each other to work on tasks.
- Need a place to store flint and coal (depot?)
- Make it so unearthing a corpse with a tunnel below it doesn't modify terrain.
- Grass should grow outside
- Some corpses should have trade goods
- Incomplete features, excavations...what is to be done?
- Paved floor as feature.
- Stonemason as structure?
- Construct tasks should maybe lists their needed ingredients?  maybe other tasks as well?

Features:
- We need some way to dismantle and/or repair, but we don't want tasks to proliferate (build/repair the same...unassign/dismantle the same?)
- Next Structure and Next Minion aren't actually implemented.
