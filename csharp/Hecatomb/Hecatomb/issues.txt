Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?
- Need confirmation for saved games
- The background color for severe wounds can clash with the foreground color.
- TextEntry keystroke responsiveness feels horrible.
- Maybe vampire bats should be cave shrikes or something.
- Additional spacebar selection clicks register too quickly
* should be able to overlay partial construct using same building (fixed I think)
* Right now there's really weird treatment of abandoned build or dig tasks (probably fixed)
- We need Particle emitter constructors that can do colors and stuff
- Maybe research tasks should show turns when there are no ingredients
- Zombies somehow can get stuck highlighted, so can structures.
- Easy way to count zombies?
- Call things "rotten" when they are decaying?


Gameplay issues:
* dropped items should get unclaimed...is that an issue?  I don't think it is, I think we unclaim upon pickup.
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks...maybe put in some debugging code to catch tasks that just sit there...should be testable using interface and locals
* Should prefer paths around water and slopes.
* CanReach doesn't respect cached misses; perhaps we should refactor it (I'm not sure this is true)
- Dwarf lairs have no dwarves in them
- Dwarf lairs can overlap with bat caves
- Balance ghoul attacks
- You can't set up triggers to breach multiple caverns at once.
- Should I add a simple raid?  This actually can't be done without refactoring how the Entity list works.
- should test decaying stuff
- Decay isn't fully thought out
- No guaranteed trees (or flint) near start
- There can be pathfinding delays when finding ingredients just to display the menu
- Pathfinding now avoids high movement costs, but wandering doesn't.
* Bandits sometimes slam performance...I think this was solved by filling vaults on-the-fly
- Want to add in some LongCreatures somewhere.
* too hard to find flint in early game - arguably fixed
- crashed with OutOfMemory error when saving
- The abandoned tasks appear to occur when the Minion loses its task but the task still has the Minion.
	- Are there times when we assign a task and it overwrites another?
	- Should I look for every occurrence of task = null or unassign?  or overwriting?
	- I could also just write something to clean up automatically.
- I'm getting "what the heck?" as the name for a haul task...maybe that's after it's been picked up?
* Unclear why Deck and Queue from TurnHandler appear as serialized fields (resolved, I handle them in a customized way)
- ForbidTask appears to do nothing and also have no name
- Ghoul radius is too small
- Notification for canceling dig task for hard walls?
- Should nighttime be a bit more dangerous?
- I can't seem to furnish a door on top of a damaged door.
- I saw a grave occur next to a slope...first time I've seen that in ages
- Oh, we finally have a listener priority issue...Minion (patrolling around the player) versus RallyTask (rallying around the task)
- Are bone and flesh harvested not claimed? No, the issue was related to the next issue.
- If something is claimed by a haul task, should I be able to unclaim it for other tasks?
* Spiders not moving...solved, that was leftover test code
- Should add spider silk and a use thereof
- Need a way to cycle trades


Performance Issues:
* Don't need to serialize hostility matrix
* The VaultHandler takes up about a sixth of the line count, and has many redundant messages.
- We serialize a lot of unnecessary stuff in general.
* Is it that bandits at long distance flog performance?
- Arguably should use iteration rather than recursion for NextActor.
- WalkToward should probably use cache.

Other issue

Needs testing:
* Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?  Seems to.
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?  It's very slow, that's for sure.
- Did something despawn when I saved the game?

New Features:
- We need good ways to keep zombies indoors during sieges.
- A rally point would work for this for now.
