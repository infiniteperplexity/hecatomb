Interface issues:
- Something weird is going on with the fonts and box-drawing characters.
- Text panels don't do spacing correctly.
- Many of the names show up wrong.
- Tasks should have different background colors.
- Does the hover menu update as it should?
- Should I rethink what happens in the menu panel on splash screens?

Gameplay issues:
- Workers sometimes abandon tasks.


Needs testing:
- Does friendly displacement of workers do what's intended?
- Do we fetch ingredients for multi-ingredient tasks in a reasonable way?
- Has the frustration mechanic been fully implemented?

New Features:
- Better ways to control zombie behavior.

Working on:
- Should make it so WalkToward caches misses
- The WalkToward / attacking code is a huge mess
- Make sure death and despawning are separate, don't drop items when just despawning
- Need to account for siege creatures that can't even reach the player through doors?
