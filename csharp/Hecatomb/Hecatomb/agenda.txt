In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Nice bite-sized chunks:
* deal with the ingredient menu slam.
* show turns on research tasks
* no more "stuck highlights"...maybe make that a singleton state
* deal with double-use of Z
* fix build to unassign dig in walls
* "wait" recenters on selection
* implement forbidtask
* notify on hard walls cancel dig
* add a way to cycle trades
* colorize the tasks
* better naming and colors for rotten stuff, check that corpses rot
* Make it so corpses show signs of rot I guess.
* revise code for guaranteeing starting area
* test furnishing door on top of damaged door to repair
* Is there any way to repair a damaged structural feature?
* I don't think the corpse names showed up correctly?
* zombies arguably rot too fast
* don't need to show ingredients for haul tasks or butcher tasks
* sanctum should allow +1 zombie
* clicking creature should prioritize over clicking structure
* maybe randomize starting decay?
? graphics for chirurgeon are a bit repetitive to sanctum
? number of turns left doesn't update correctly while waiting (believed fixed)
? trade task display name should tell me turns left.
? trade task in building description has badly formatted name
* rotten zombies shouldn't leave corpses
* keep an eye out for bad task names
* "zombie couldn't find needed keys"?   wtf?
* I got a "what the heck?" haul one rock message...so this is when a haul tasks has no claims, which means it's invalid.
* got a crash from hovering over a butcher tasks whose corpse had decayed out from under it
* keep an eye out for the desynced tasks...or did we solve that?  I think I saw one recently.
- check priority stuff for event-based action overrides
- should add unclaim task soon
* updating research turns on menu doesn't work still
- change slaughterhouse to meat locker
* message when zombie expires
* I don't think task priority is working? no, it is.
* haul task carried by uses wrong name
- should I require starting trees on the same z level, or 1 lower?
- should add deconstruction of workshop for flint?
- need to think entire way of handling pathfinding for sieges...they won't attack outdoor structures.
* let's get rid of this message "trying look at despawned components?"
* "butcher a corpse from" makes no sense when it's on the hovered task...actually it never makes sense
* butcher tasks should go faster
* add better trades...coal, etc.
* get rid of article name in black market, and it should have ingredients listed; it seems like we aren't fulfilling the ingredients in the normal way? 
- bake coal in furnace?
- do we have speed adjustment?
* weird stuff going on newly generated trade tasks
- need a place to put trade goods for storage
* I think there's a race condition when you kick off a new game (I think this is now fixed)
* Why are we skipping the "click any button" stage?
- got no message when zombie rotted away
- too many "assigned material too hard status bar messages
- Oh wow, Unassign was asymmetrical...that's probably been the culprit all along
- Should we lose message history when we save/restore?
- wtf "ravens"
- diagonal grave digging should also not dig a hole
- Forge also looks like Sanctum



finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.
