In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Design issues:
- Probably want some sort of busywork task
- Should there be a furnace that can bake coal?
- Should we save message history in state?
* Should there be way to dispose of rotted zombies?  And should rotted zombies be weaker?
* The guard post should do stuff.
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
* should make the guard post do stuff
* these spells should actually do stuff
- Add some techs to the library
* give us a heal-all debugging spell
* give us a fresh zombie spell
* orcs or something in warrens
* make sieges progress
- maybe I should move the research bonus checker to a global bonus checker
* we have some typos...corpsegot displaced.
* maybe delay bandits a bit?
- how did that goblin end up here?
- you often move a bit to start, which sort of defeats the purpose of the "distance from start" checks
* get spurious "Can't butcher corpse" thing.
* the bandits attacked their own wolfhound...but they don't normally do that...well...this happened twice through normal generation, but none with debugging
* we need to refactor PushMessage so it handles sensory stuff sensibly
- still very rarely get graves next to down slopes
- "Your severely wounded zombie has perished" is maybe a bit wordy
* higher mana totals should regenerate faster
* butcher corpse should select an area
* we have too many trade goods, or they are too close
* tell what direction the bandits are coming from
* test second bandit attack?
* make it so you can start research without ingredients
* we got a pile of 0 trade goods
- for once we're getting slogged by successful searches 
- various display issues with status panel...text not wrapping, need to show day info and stuff
- not wrapping splash lines

combat testing:
- So...remind myself what their stats are?  So currently nothing has any stats whatsoever.
- Attacker has Accuracy and Damage
- Defender has Armor, Evasion, and Toughness, plus Wounds which is always fixed.
- implement player death
- Can double increase with guardpost
	- also it has infinite range...do we want that?


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.
