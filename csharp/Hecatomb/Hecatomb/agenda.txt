In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Nice bite-sized chunks:
* deal with the ingredient menu slam.
* show turns on research tasks
* no more "stuck highlights"...maybe make that a singleton state
* deal with double-use of Z
* fix build to unassign dig in walls
* "wait" recenters on selection
* implement forbidtask
* notify on hard walls cancel dig
* add a way to cycle trades
* colorize the tasks
* better naming and colors for rotten stuff, check that corpses rot
* Make it so corpses show signs of rot I guess.
* revise code for guaranteeing starting area
* test furnishing door on top of damaged door to repair
* Is there any way to repair a damaged structural feature?
- keep an eye out for the unassigned tasks...or did we solve that?
- check priority stuff for event-based action overrides
- keep an eye out for bad task names
- trade task display name should tell me turns left.
- trade task in building description has badly formatted name
- I don't think the corpse names showed up correctly?
- list number of zombies somewhere!
- number of turns left doesn't update correctly while waiting
- zombies arguably rot too fast
- don't need to show ingredients for haul tasks or butcher tasks
- should flesh rot when it's not stored?
- sanctum should allow +1 zombie
- should add unclaim task soon
- clicking creature should prioritize over clicking structure
- maybe randomize starting decay?
- graphics for chirurgeon are a bit repetitive to sanctum
- I got a "what the heck?" haul one rock message
- I think I got an abandoned task finally
- rotten zombies shouldn't leave corpses
- "zombie couldn't find needed keys"?   wtf?
- we're getting the "haul task with no claims" message sometimes
- got a crash from hovering over a butcher tasks whose corpse had decayed out from under it

finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.
