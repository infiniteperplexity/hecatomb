In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Design issues:
- Probably want some sort of busywork task
- Should there be a furnace that can bake coal?
- Should we save message history in state?
* Should there be way to dispose of rotted zombies?  And should rotted zombies be weaker?
* The guard post should do stuff.
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
* should make the guard post do stuff
* these spells should actually do stuff
- Add some techs to the library
- give us a heal-all debugging spell
- give us a fresh zombie spell
- orcs or something in warrens
- make sieges progress

combat testing:
- So...remind myself what their stats are?  So currently nothing has any stats whatsoever.
- Attacker has Accuracy and Damage
- Defender has Armor, Evasion, and Toughness, plus Wounds which is always fixed.


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.
