Current interface issues:
- Should certain events force you into log mode?  Or maybe highlight the log in magenta?
- Ideally want to get time of day, phase of moon, and total turn number on there.
- Should Log light up when there is unviewed text?
- TurnHandler is accessed in a bizarre way incompatible with other state handlers

In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Tutorial notes:
- Maybe hide certain screens to minimize distractions at start?
- Is a dig task still the best first thing?  Maybe just cut trees and build a workshop? That requires flint.
- Tutorial should hint at tasks to come
- Where should we note what different buildings do?
- Research complete text is the wrong color



Design issues:
- Probably want some sort of busywork task
- Should there be a furnace that can bake coal?
- Should we save message history in state?
* Should there be way to dispose of rotted zombies?  And should rotted zombies be weaker?
* The guard post should do stuff.
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
* should make the guard post do stuff
* these spells should actually do stuff
- Add some techs to the library
* give us a heal-all debugging spell
* give us a fresh zombie spell
* orcs or something in warrens
* make sieges progress
- maybe I should move the research bonus checker to a global bonus checker
* we have some typos...corpsegot displaced.
* maybe delay bandits a bit?
- how did that goblin end up here?
- you often move a bit to start, which sort of defeats the purpose of the "distance from start" checks
* get spurious "Can't butcher corpse" thing.
* the bandits attacked their own wolfhound...but they don't normally do that...well...this happened twice through normal generation, but none with debugging
* we need to refactor PushMessage so it handles sensory stuff sensibly
- "Your severely wounded zombie has perished" is maybe a bit wordy
* higher mana totals should regenerate faster
* butcher corpse should select an area
* we have too many trade goods, or they are too close
* tell what direction the bandits are coming from
* test second bandit attack?
* make it so you can start research without ingredients
* we got a pile of 0 trade goods
* not wrapping splash lines (or rather, we need to manually set margins)
- still very rarely get graves next to down slopes
- for once we're getting slogged by successful searches 
- various display issues with status panel...text not wrapping, need to show day info and stuff (target 1280x720px)
- better spell names
- "research on researching X complete"
* can hover one tile past some edges of the screen
- was water supposed to flicker when the mouse moved?
* should have a more organized way to dirtify panels.
- is newest message at top a good system?
- need some way to keep your zombies indoors
- we need a more modular command system here...

combat testing:
- So...remind myself what their stats are?  So currently nothing has any stats whatsoever.
- Attacker has Accuracy and Damage
- Defender has Armor, Evasion, and Toughness, plus Wounds which is always fixed.
- implement player death
- Can double increase with guardpost
	- also it has infinite range...do we want that?


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.

Does the new interface account for pause and speed?
