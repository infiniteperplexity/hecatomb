What does a thorough test look like?
- Max out the tech tree and build all the things.
- Fight the bandits, cast spells at them, and use traps.



Hecatomb brainstorm: The game isn't very fun once you reach the "waiting for bandit siege" stage.
1) I could just make the bandit siege much easier.  Make it so there's only one bandit, for example.
2) I could replace the bandit siege with an expedition...to hunt spider nests?  We already have wandering spiders.  One issue is that there is no early-game use for spider silk or anything like that so far.  Maybe to make trade goods?
3) I mean, in theory you can go dig up graves and risk getting attacked by ghouls.  Maybe make the ghouls pop up only when the graves are disturbed?
4) Could make it so you can dig for caves or something.
5) Could make it so there are multiple places you can go for trade goods.
6) Could make it so the market requires copper instead?
7) Could make it so there are random wandering hunters or hermits.
8) Revamp things so gold is a currency, and all black market transactions either give or require gold.
9) Also, call it a trading post instead of a black market.
10) Have there be small villages nearby.
11) Have there be special tombs pre-gens you can rob.
12) Make scattered rocks like gold in Don't Starve Together.
13) Special crops to garden
14) Sunken treasure chests.
15) Add an herb garden structure, grows random plants?
16) Require additional kinds of corpses for advancement.
17) Require a magical ore for advancement.
18) Hunt down slimes...might sort of overlap with ectoplasm though.
19) Hunt aquatic creatures, like fish.
20) Needing to gather charcoal or some kind of lava thing.
Of these, what I really like are:
	- Making the first bandit attack be only one.
	- Make gold the universal currency.
	- Pregen tombs.


Fresh issues list starting on 2/14/2020:
* Saplings will never become trees
- Should we allow pageUp to scroll through messages?
- Possibly should add the text alerts to the tutorial
- Building fixtures under water removes water, even though that logic is meant to remove grass
- Show the latest message on default screens, not just message log.
- AddToMockEntity is a dummy method that totally doesn't work
* add flower growth to growth handler
* does the hover for furnish fixture format the names wrong...yes, fixed
* Okay...cautiously going back to a normal PRNG for choosing randomized trades, because the non-randomness of the other one was extremely obvious
- go back and put more restrictions on random colors at some point
- try to get rid of the triple initiation for state handlers
* dye colors get reinitialized between items and features
* add planting tasks for trees and flowers
- some dye colors are hard to read on the menu
* how shall we handle background dyes
- how are we going to dye plain tiles with no features?
- Is it risky to double up names of flowers with resources?
- add dyes to Black Market potential trades
* add an apothecary to support dyeing
* Should we highlight achievements in magenta when there is a new one?
* Deep water uses the wrong glyph
* Did a zombie stepto an air space to harvest a web, when the slope got dug out from under it?
* Add in a bunch of achievements

- We don't actually allow for the possibility, currently, that a fixture may require other than 10 labor
* It's easy to get a stuck in a key-board only mode where you keep clicking on minions after exiting minion selection mode.	
- Does the mending task auto-cancel because the zombie isn't injured?
- Some issues with dig tasks, some of which are shared with build tasks:
	- Canceled incomplete tasks have absolute priority; do we want that or should they use the priority of their terrain?
	- Or maybe I should just get rid of incomplete excavations?
	- I'm not sure how I deal with features that can't be harvested.
- Slaughterhouse should be able to disassemble zombies.
* Should we be able to fight in message mode?  The whole idea of that doesn't really work unless we track whether we're in camera mode, and maybe have the message thing as an overlay?
- Give a message for defeating bandits, dryads, et cetera?
- want some use for spider corpses
- Should rotting be a little slower?
- Is there some kind of race condition in saved games?
* Should we regenerate mana faster on a sanctum?
- Should grass grow under spear traps?
- Should traps be able to go on slopes?
- I didn't see dryads after a pop-up warning
- Ideally, invalid tasks would be caught and canceled when you're trying to walk toward them, not just when you try to work them.
- Can't duplicate the issue of research menu not showing how to exit
- Message to tell how you died.  That guy got killed by an angry nymph.  Shouldn't it have raised a blurb about that?
- Should I catch Exception in the minor asynchronous threads, like SplashControls and such?
- I think I'm making a mistake by having the bandit attack be the first "event"
- Is escape a good way to get to the system menu?  I feel like I back out one too many steps more than I'd like.
- Some people have had trouble finding the deeper ores.
- I got a very strange error while trying to quit?  Like...it tried to accept a "wait" command after the world had been torn down? 
- Bandits show up around 1:11:45
- I'm not crazy about the mana cap approach to limiting zombies; it makes new zombies very expensive.



New features:
- Add pregen tombs to rob.

Playtest issues:
- In the long term we might want to make CanFindResources see carried items
- Spiders should eventually respawn
- It's possible that I missed one or more bugs related to hauling/ingredients/claims/priority, but I did test as much chaos as possible.
- Rally tasks for minions would require an event priority system...I know I need that eventually...disable rally task for now
- Feature ownership is not implemented, right now we just use Defender presence or absence


Interface issues:
- menu items wrapping because it's narrow looks kind of ugly.
- Still got a tombstone next to the edge somehow...this is very rare and hard to duplicate.
- Is "Avatar" a good name, or should it be "Control", "Pilot", "Incarnate"?
- tombstones adjacenet sometimes?  is that a problem?
- should have fixed order for listing minion types and resources.
- Should tabbing to a minion snap the cursor to that square?
- Construct task shows ingredients when NoIngredients is true
- Pushmessage goes through some weird hoops.
- Should we put timestamps on messages?


Design issues:
- Probably want some sort of busywork task
- Should there be a furnace that can bake coal?
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
* these spells should actually do stuff
- Add some techs to the library
* orcs or something in warrens
* make sieges progress
- maybe I should move the research bonus checker to a global bonus checker
* maybe delay bandits a bit?
- how did that goblin end up here?
- you often move a bit to start, which sort of defeats the purpose of the "distance from start" checks
* get spurious "Can't butcher corpse" thing.
* the bandits attacked their own wolfhound...but they don't normally do that...well...this happened twice through normal generation, but none with debugging
- "Your severely wounded zombie has perished" is maybe a bit wordy
* higher mana totals should regenerate faster
* butcher corpse should select an area
* we have too many trade goods, or they are too close
* tell what direction the bandits are coming from
* test second bandit attack?
* we got a pile of 0 trade goods
- still very rarely get graves next to down slopes
- for once we're getting slogged by successful searches 
- various display issues with status panel...text not wrapping, need to show day info and stuff (target 1280x720px)
- better spell names
- was water supposed to flicker when the mouse moved?
- need some way to keep your zombies indoors


combat testing:
- So...remind myself what their stats are?  So currently nothing has any stats whatsoever.
- Attacker has Accuracy and Damage
- Defender has Armor, Evasion, and Toughness, plus Wounds which is always fixed.
- implement player death
- Can double increase with guardpost
	- also it has infinite range...do we want that?


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.

Does the new interface account for pause and speed?
