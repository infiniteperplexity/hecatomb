Hecatomb brainstorm: The game isn't very fun once you reach the "waiting for bandit siege" stage.
1) I could just make the bandit siege much easier.  Make it so there's only one bandit, for example.
2) I could replace the bandit siege with an expedition...to hunt spider nests?  We already have wandering spiders.  One issue is that there is no early-game use for spider silk or anything like that so far.  Maybe to make trade goods?
3) I mean, in theory you can go dig up graves and risk getting attacked by ghouls.  Maybe make the ghouls pop up only when the graves are disturbed?
4) Could make it so you can dig for caves or something.
5) Could make it so there are multiple places you can go for trade goods.
6) Could make it so the market requires copper instead?
7) Could make it so there are random wandering hunters or hermits.
8) Revamp things so gold is a currency, and all black market transactions either give or require gold.
9) Also, call it a trading post instead of a black market.
10) Have there be small villages nearby.
11) Have there be special tombs pre-gens you can rob.
12) Make scattered rocks like gold in Don't Starve Together.
13) Special crops to garden
14) Sunken treasure chests.
15) Add an herb garden structure, grows random plants?
16) Require additional kinds of corpses for advancement.
17) Require a magical ore for advancement.
18) Hunt down slimes...might sort of overlap with ectoplasm though.
19) Hunt aquatic creatures, like fish.
20) Needing to gather charcoal or some kind of lava thing.
Of these, what I really like are:
	- Making the first bandit attack be only one.
	- Make gold the universal currency.
	- Pregen tombs.


Fresh issues list starting on 2/14/2020:
- Stored resources show up for broken buildings
- Deconstruct task assignment prioritizes over digging
- Should rotting be a little slower
- Is there some kind of race condition in saved games?
- Should we regenerate mana faster on a sanctum?
- Achievements are totally wrong
- Should grass grow under spear traps
- Should traps be able to go on slopes
- I didn't see dryads after a pop-up warning
- I think there are some bugs relating to the intro screen and saving and loading, but they are hard to reproduce.
- Include versioning and build number.
- Come up with a "Release checklist" that definitely includes setting the options back to normal.
- Ideally, invalid tasks would be caught and canceled when you're trying to walk toward them, not just when you try to work them.
* If you assign a digtask in an unexplored area that contains a tree, it won't auto-cancel when you explore it.
* I think I fixed the building reconstruction issues
- Apparently some weird things can happen if displacement causes a creature to fall
* Need a better bug reporting system:
	* email pops up.
* Can't see mana while choosing a spell.
* I think I fixed relative paths for saved games and crash reports.
* I *think* I fixed the weird issues where TurnHandler didn't act like other state handlers
- Can't duplicate the issue of research menu not showing how to exit
* Someome had a crash while deconstructing a stockpile...that's probably fixed now.
- Message to tell how you died.  That guy got killed by an angry nymph.  Shouldn't it have raised a blurb about that?
- Should I catch Exception in the minor asynchronous threads, like SplashControls and such?
- Ugh I just lost a bunch of notes...let's see what I can reconstruct.
	* Can we get trade goods both by raising zombies and harvesting graves?
	- I think I'm making a mistake by having the bandit attack be the first "event"
	* We should be able to "click" on buildings and minions without using the mouse.
	* We don't seem to be getting the "really overwrite save file" message
	- Why can't we see the chirurgeon?
	* Can we move the forbid task down on the list
	- Is escape a good way to get to the system menu?  I feel like I back out one too many steps more than I'd like.
	- Some people have had trouble finding the deeper ores.
	* Might be good to fix that "can't see spellcasting mana" issue.
- I'm not sure chirurgy should be a prerequisite for the chirurgeon, or maybe it should be researched at the sanctum or slaughterhouse rather than the library
- I got a very strange error while trying to quit?  Like...it tried to accept a "wait" command after the world had been torn down? 
- Now we still can't see mana while choosing a spell during the tutorial but I think I'm okay with that
- Bandits show up around 1:11:45
- I'm not crazy about the mana cap approach to limiting zombies; it makes new zombies very expensive.
* Made it so you can navigate around while viewing creatures or structures.



New features:
- Make gold the universal currency.
- Add pregen tombs to rob.
- Make the first bandit attack be just one or two.

Playtest issues:
- In the long term we might want to make CanFindResources see carried items
- Spiders should eventually respawn
- It's possible that I missed one or more bugs related to hauling/ingredients/claims/priority, but I did test as much chaos as possible.
- Rally tasks for minions would require an event priority system...I know I need that eventually...disable rally task for now
- Feature ownership is not implemented, right now we just use Defender presence or absence


Interface issues:
- menu items wrapping because it's narrow looks kind of ugly.
- Still got a tombstone next to the edge somehow...this is very rare and hard to duplicate.
- Is "Avatar" a good name, or should it be "Control", "Pilot", "Incarnate"?
- tombstones adjacenet sometimes?  is that a problem?
- should have fixed order for listing minion types and resources.
- Should tabbing to a minion snap the cursor to that square?
- Construct task shows ingredients when NoIngredients is true
- Pushmessage goes through some weird hoops.
- Should we put timestamps on messages?


Design issues:
- Probably want some sort of busywork task
- Should there be a furnace that can bake coal?
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
* these spells should actually do stuff
- Add some techs to the library
* orcs or something in warrens
* make sieges progress
- maybe I should move the research bonus checker to a global bonus checker
* maybe delay bandits a bit?
- how did that goblin end up here?
- you often move a bit to start, which sort of defeats the purpose of the "distance from start" checks
* get spurious "Can't butcher corpse" thing.
* the bandits attacked their own wolfhound...but they don't normally do that...well...this happened twice through normal generation, but none with debugging
- "Your severely wounded zombie has perished" is maybe a bit wordy
* higher mana totals should regenerate faster
* butcher corpse should select an area
* we have too many trade goods, or they are too close
* tell what direction the bandits are coming from
* test second bandit attack?
* we got a pile of 0 trade goods
- still very rarely get graves next to down slopes
- for once we're getting slogged by successful searches 
- various display issues with status panel...text not wrapping, need to show day info and stuff (target 1280x720px)
- better spell names
- was water supposed to flicker when the mouse moved?
- need some way to keep your zombies indoors


combat testing:
- So...remind myself what their stats are?  So currently nothing has any stats whatsoever.
- Attacker has Accuracy and Damage
- Defender has Armor, Evasion, and Toughness, plus Wounds which is always fixed.
- implement player death
- Can double increase with guardpost
	- also it has infinite range...do we want that?


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.

Does the new interface account for pause and speed?
