Fresh issues list starting on 2/14/2020:
* If you assign a digtask in an unexplored area that contains a tree, it won't auto-cancel when you explore it.
* I think I fixed the building reconstruction issues
- Apparently some weird things can happen if displacement causes a creature to fall
* Need a better bug reporting system:
	* email pops up.
* Can't see mana while choosing a spell.
* I think I fixed relative paths for saved games and crash reports.
* I *think* I fixed the weird issues where TurnHandler didn't act like other state handlers
- Can't duplicate the issue of research menu not showing how to exit
* Someome had a crash while deconstructing a stockpile...that's probably fixed now.
- Message to tell how you died.  That guy got killed by an angry nymph.  Shouldn't it have raised a blurb about that?
- Should I catch Exception in the minor asynchronous threads, like SplashControls and such?
- Ugh I just lost a bunch of notes...let's see what I can reconstruct.
	* Can we get trade goods both by raising zombies and harvesting graves?
	- I think I'm making a mistake by having the bandit attack be the first "event"
	* We should be able to "click" on buildings and minions without using the mouse.
	* We don't seem to be getting the "really overwrite save file" message
	- Why can't we see the chirurgeon?
	* Can we move the forbid task down on the list
	- Is escape a good way to get to the system menu?  I feel like I back out one too many steps more than I'd like.
	- Some people have had trouble finding the deeper ores.
	* Might be good to fix that "can't see spellcasting mana" issue.
- I'm not sure chirurgy should be a prerequisite for the chirurgeon, or maybe it should be researched at the sanctum or slaughterhouse rather than the library
- I got a very strange error while trying to quit?  Like...it tried to accept a "wait" command after the world had been torn down? 
- Now we still can't see mana while choosing a spell during the tutorial but I think I'm okay with that
- Bandits show up around 1:11:45
- I'm not crazy about the mana cap approach to limiting zombies; it makes new zombies very expensive.
* Made it so you can navigate around while viewing creatures or structures.

Playtest issues:
- In the long term we might want to make CanFindResources see carried items
- Spiders should eventually respawn
- It's possible that I missed one or more bugs related to hauling/ingredients/claims/priority, but I did test as much chaos as possible.
- Rally tasks for minions would require an event priority system...I know I need that eventually...disable rally task for now
- Feature ownership is not implemented, right now we just use Defender presence or absence


Interface issues:
- menu items wrapping because it's narrow looks kind of ugly.
- Still got a tombstone next to the edge somehow...this is very rare and hard to duplicate.
- Is "Avatar" a good name, or should it be "Control", "Pilot", "Incarnate"?
- tombstones adjacenet sometimes?  is that a problem?
- should have fixed order for listing minion types and resources.
- Should tabbing to a minion snap the cursor to that square?
- Construct task shows ingredients when NoIngredients is true
- Pushmessage goes through some weird hoops.
- Should we put timestamps on messages?


Design issues:
- Probably want some sort of busywork task
- Should there be a furnace that can bake coal?
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
* these spells should actually do stuff
- Add some techs to the library
* orcs or something in warrens
* make sieges progress
- maybe I should move the research bonus checker to a global bonus checker
* maybe delay bandits a bit?
- how did that goblin end up here?
- you often move a bit to start, which sort of defeats the purpose of the "distance from start" checks
* get spurious "Can't butcher corpse" thing.
* the bandits attacked their own wolfhound...but they don't normally do that...well...this happened twice through normal generation, but none with debugging
- "Your severely wounded zombie has perished" is maybe a bit wordy
* higher mana totals should regenerate faster
* butcher corpse should select an area
* we have too many trade goods, or they are too close
* tell what direction the bandits are coming from
* test second bandit attack?
* we got a pile of 0 trade goods
- still very rarely get graves next to down slopes
- for once we're getting slogged by successful searches 
- various display issues with status panel...text not wrapping, need to show day info and stuff (target 1280x720px)
- better spell names
- was water supposed to flicker when the mouse moved?
- need some way to keep your zombies indoors


combat testing:
- So...remind myself what their stats are?  So currently nothing has any stats whatsoever.
- Attacker has Accuracy and Damage
- Defender has Armor, Evasion, and Toughness, plus Wounds which is always fixed.
- implement player death
- Can double increase with guardpost
	- also it has infinite range...do we want that?


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.

Does the new interface account for pause and speed?
