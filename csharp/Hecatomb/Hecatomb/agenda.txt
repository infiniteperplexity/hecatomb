In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Nice bite-sized chunks:
- colorize the tasks
- deal with the ingredient menu slam.
- show turns on research tasks
- no more "stuck highlights"...maybe make that a singleton state
- better naming and colors for rotten stuff, check that corpses rot
- deal with double-use of Z
- fix build to unassign dig in walls
- "wait" recenters on selection
- revise code for guaranteeing starting area
- keep an eye out for the unassigned tasks...or did we solve that?
- implement forbidtask
- notify on hard walls cancel dig
- test furnishing door on top of damaged door to repair
- check priority stuff for event-based action overrides
- add a way to cycle trades


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
