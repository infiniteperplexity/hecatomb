In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Nice bite-sized chunks:
* deal with the ingredient menu slam.
* show turns on research tasks
* no more "stuck highlights"...maybe make that a singleton state
* deal with double-use of Z
* fix build to unassign dig in walls
* "wait" recenters on selection
* implement forbidtask
* notify on hard walls cancel dig
* add a way to cycle trades
* colorize the tasks
* better naming and colors for rotten stuff, check that corpses rot
- Make it so corpses show signs of rot I guess.
- revise code for guaranteeing starting area
- keep an eye out for the unassigned tasks...or did we solve that?
- test furnishing door on top of damaged door to repair
- Is there any way to repair a damaged structural feature?
- check priority stuff for event-based action overrides



finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.

starting area:
- a grave within sight on the same level
- trees within a certain distance
- possibly, flint

rotting stuff:
- so far I've been doing a slight, somewhat, severely, critically thing.
- Severely rotted, rotted, slightly rotted
- brown, olive, green
