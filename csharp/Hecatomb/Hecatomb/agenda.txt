In order to have a playable demo...
- We need to have an installer that works all the way...at this point I definitely still need uninstall icons and so on.
- Not all interface stuff needs to be awesome.
- We do probably need to be free of common crashes and major performance slams.


Nice bite-sized chunks:

- check priority stuff for event-based action overrides
- change slaughterhouse to meat locker
- should I require starting trees on the same z level, or 1 lower?
- need to think entire way of handling pathfinding for sieges...they won't attack outdoor structures.
- bake coal in furnace?
- need a place to put trade goods for storage
- Should we lose message history when we save/restore?
- wtf "ravens"
- need a way to send messages along with destroying something; e.g. this is how it died.
- separate furnace from forge, for coal?
- should make the guard post do stuff
- can we convert the FlyWeight strings to Enums so they can't crash?
- I don't like pale yellow background for research tasks
- claimed items should maybe say so?
- way to dispose of rotted zombies?
- need busy-work tasks?


finalizing
- set all options correctly
- remove debugger spells
- Make sure all the documentation and tutorials are correct.
