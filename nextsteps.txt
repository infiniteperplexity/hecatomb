- do we need StructureLight on every structure???  I think I do, because of how Behavior merging works.
- use mana to build structures?  energize structure spell?  ectoplasm?
- unite various forms of hauling and claiming so we can handle market trading?
- so...I *could* add HaulTasks as-is...or overhaul.

- test combat near guardpost
- add highlight to guard post
- make research work only in center?
- patrol around guardpost by default
